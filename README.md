# Academic Coding Portfolio

[cite_start]This repository serves as a professional record of my technical foundation and academic progression in Computer Science and Engineering[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]It highlights my transition from foundational logic to complex system architecture and numerical analysis[cite: 3, 4].

> **Note on Academic Integrity:** To comply with university honor codes, the source code for these assignments is maintained in a **private repository**. I am happy to provide access or walk through the logic during a technical interview or upon request.
