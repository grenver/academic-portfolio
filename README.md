# Academic Coding Portfolio

This repository serves as a professional record of my technical foundation and academic progression in Computer Science and Engineering. It highlights my transition from foundational logic to complex system architecture and numerical analysis.

> **Note on Academic Integrity:** To comply with university honor codes, the source code for these assignments is maintained in a **private repository**. I am happy to provide access or walk through the logic during a technical interview or upon request.

## Technical Skills
* **Languages:** Java and Python.
* **Libraries and Frameworks:** NumPy, Matplotlib, and JUnit.
* **Engineering Tools:** Git, GitHub, LaTeX, IntelliJ, and VS Code.

## Java Technical Milestones
* **Systems Design:** Developed a multi-user Distribution Fulfillment System featuring role-based access control for Admin, Warehouse, and Customer roles, alongside automated system timeouts.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Built a Patient Management System utilizing modular classes, accessor methods, and complex data relationships between patients and procedures.
* **Data Validation:** Created a Rainfall Statistics tool using arrays and robust input validation to calculate annual totals and monthly averages.
* **File I/O and Scripting:** Built a Line Numbering Utility that processes external text files and indexes content using the Scanner library.

## Python and Engineering Computation
* **Physics Modeling and Visualization:** Developed a Ballistic Trajectory Simulator using Matplotlib to calculate and plot projectile motion based on user-defined velocity and launch angles.
* **Numerical Analysis:** Implemented matrix multiplication through both manual nested-loop algorithms and optimized NumPy dot product operations.
* **System Logic Design:** Authored a design for a Sensor Network state machine that tracks sequential triggers and validates speed thresholds between sensors.
* **Mathematical Approximations:** Created a Taylor Series function to approximate natural exponential functions with custom factorial logic and convergence monitoring.
* **Statistical Computation:** Built a manual covariance calculator to validate statistical results against population-adjusted NumPy data.
